win32-sms
=========

SMS interface for GSM modems (cell-phones plugged into your computer) that 
uses the Win32 API for serial communications so that it does not need to
be compiled and does not rely on additional gems.

SAMPLE
======
Here are the basics. Note, when you call process it will call 
fetch_and_delete_stored_messages which will fetch all of the messages off of 
your main mailbox and delete them. Permanently.  
  
  require 'win32/sms'
  modem = Win32::Sms.new("COM5")
  modem.sms "+19519020972", "Hi Jeff, I am testing your gem"
  messages = modem.process
