ABOUT
=========

SMS interface for GSM modems (cell-phones plugged into your computer) that 
uses the Win32 API for serial communications on windows so that it does not need 
to be compiled and does not rely on additional gems. On Linux and BSD it 
relies on the serialport gem.

  sudo gem install toholio-serialport -s http://gems.github.com

SAMPLE
======
Here are the basics. Note, when you call process it will call 
fetch_and_delete_stored_messages which will fetch all of the messages off of 
your main mailbox and delete them. Permanently.  
  
  require 'sms'
  # On Windows send "COM1", on OSX send something like "/dev/tty.usbmodem1a21"
  modem = Sms.new("COM5")
  modem.sms "+19519020972", "Hi Jeff, I am testing your gem"
  messages = modem.process
